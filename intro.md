# Automated Reasoning in Python

## Why Automated Reasoning?

Because it is beautiful and pleasant.

I will not claim that automated reasoning is guaranteed to solve all your ills. I don't believe it.

What I do believe is that life is meant to be lived well. And for some of us, that involves studying beautiful ideas. Automated reasoning, physics, mathematics, and even computer science for me are not at their heart about pragmatics. The reason society at large promotes them is for their technological offshoots. It is good they help people, make others and ourselves comfortable and rich. I feel however that rationally maximizing pragmatics to it's logical conclusions leads us to not live well.

## Why Python?

Python is the modern Lingua Franca of computing.

I do think using a specific executable  programming language is important. There are advnantages to others, but as a communication medium.
I could perhaps have invented some new programming language to write this book in. Then there would be the double task of learning the contents of the book and

Because of it's origin as a scripting language, I think python is ok at writing small programs.

A wonderful thing about computers, like physics and experimental science, is that things _move_. There are more objective things outside ourselves that can validate our ideas.

It has not had that status for long and may not retain it for all that long either. If I were to write this book in the 2000s, I might have chosen Java.

TODO: make this less insane.
