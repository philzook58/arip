    "Judgements are pieces of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy confusion to fall into is to conflate the judgement with the thing the judgement is about. We can discuss whether a ballon is red without knowing if the the balloon is actually red. In this way, the judgement that a formula is true is not the same as the formula itself.\n",

    "We can easily distinguish the two in a programming context because they just plain aren't the same data structure.\n",

    "Proof is about playing the rules of a syntactic game. The only reason we are interesting in these rules is we have an intuitive feeling they are saying something about interesting objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a certain circularity of the concept of model. We claim that our syntactic games make sense because we can build models, which are set theoretic things. But the sticky and controversial parts of set theory about the infinite can only be carefully dealt with by considering them syntactic games also. \n",
